# Bank Portugis: Client Classification (Supervised Learning)

---

## Introduction

Used Bank Portugis's dataset to create a Supervised Learning program that predicts the success of their Telemarketing Team in selling term deposit services over one year.

Compare algorithms: KNN, SVM, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and XGBoosting to find the best predictor. Then refine the top algorithm's hyperparameters for more accurate predictions.

Apart from making classification predictions, this program aims to assist the Telemarketing Team in identifying and assessing the metrics that influence clients to choose term deposits.

**Note: Bank Portugis is not an actual institution.**
